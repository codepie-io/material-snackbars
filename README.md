# snackbar
Snackbars provide lightweight feedback about an operation. They show a brief message at the bottom of the screen on mobile and lower left on larger devices. Snackbars appear above all other elements on screen and only one can be displayed at a time.

They automatically disappear after a timeout or after user interaction elsewhere on the screen. Snackbars can be swiped off screen.
